## Core Features:

- Sentiment Analysis: Analyze the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of each stakeholder comment using AI. Output sentiment scores for each.
- Summary Generation: Generate concise summaries of stakeholder comments, preserving key points and concerns using an AI tool.
- Keyword Extraction: Identify and extract the most frequent and relevant keywords from stakeholder comments using AI, which acts as a tool that is reasoning about which concepts are highlighted by the commenters.
- Word Cloud Visualization: Generate a dynamic word cloud displaying the density of keywords used by stakeholders. Users should be able to mouse-over the word cloud to see aggregate sentiment of comments containing those words.
- Comment Filtering and Sorting: Enable users to filter comments based on sentiment scores and keywords, and sort comments by sentiment polarity.
- Overall Sentiment Indicator: Display a visual indicator representing the overall sentiment trend of all comments received (e.g., a gauge or a trend line).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and authority, reflecting the serious nature of legislative feedback.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E8EAF6), almost white, for a clean, professional look.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688) to highlight key insights and interactive elements, standing out against the dark blue without being distracting.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font with a modern look; suitable for headlines or body text
- Use simple, professional icons from a consistent set, such as Material Design Icons, to represent filters, sorting options, and sentiment types.
- Employ a clear, card-based layout for individual comments, with sentiment scores, summaries, and keywords readily visible.
- Use subtle transitions and animations (e.g., a smooth change in color) to highlight comments as users interact with filters or hover over keywords in the word cloud.
